## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

a) show the step-by-step how to solve the following system of equations in R (Use R chunks to run each part).
5->y
4->x
(2*x)+(5*y)==33
x+(3*y)==19

b) create a vector that goes from 1 to 100 and calculates the average of it WITHOUT using the R function “mean”.
n->number
x=runif(n)+1
“dplyr"

x <- list(a = list(“10”, 12, 14), b = c(3.14, 2.81))
